# Air-Quality-Prediction-in-Major-Cities-of-India
I developed a machine learning model predicting AQI in India using historical data, meteorological factors, and pollution sources, achieving 89% accuracy. This project aids in mitigating urban air pollution and showcases my skills in predictive modeling, data preprocessing, feature engineering, time-series analysis, and model evaluation.
